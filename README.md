Programming Lunatics<br />
<br />
**Easy mode:**<br />
Write a program to calculate n! where n is an **integer value** entered by the user.<br />
<br />
n\! = n x \(n-1\) x \(n-2\) x \(n-3\) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1<br />

c:\\> java Factorial <br />
n? 3 <br />
3! = 6<br />
<br />
**Now for the Lunatic...**<br />
Is it possible that numbers other than integers can be calculated, according to Gamma Function?

c:\\> java Factorial <br />
n? 0.5 <br />
0.5! = 0.88622692545<br />
<br />
Yeah, something like this.<br />
